# 🏗️ Tower Construct

**3D Autonomous Construction Simulation** — a five-storey building erected floor by floor by an automated construction site, featuring crane lifts, material deliveries, fastening robots, and real-time structural validation.

Built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), [Rapier](https://rapier.rs/) physics engine, and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## ✨ Features

- **🏢 5-Storey Building** — Columns, beams, floor slabs, and wall panels assembled floor by floor
- **🏗️ Tower Crane** — Full 3D crane with slewing jib, trolley, cable, and hook animations
- **🚛 Material Delivery Trucks** — Components arrive on-site via delivery trucks
- **🤖 Assembly Robots** — 4 autonomous robots with sensor lights patrol the construction site
- **✅ Structural Validation** — Each component flashes green when placed and validated
- **📊 HUD Progress Tracker** — Real-time phase display, component count, validation status, and floor progress
- **🎮 Interactive Camera** — Orbit controls: drag to rotate, scroll to zoom

## 🎬 Construction Sequence

The simulation follows a real-world construction workflow:

1. **Foundation** — Site preparation with concrete foundation
2. Per floor: **Columns → Beams → Floor Slab → Wall Panels → Validation**
3. **Roof** — Final roof slab placement
4. **Completion** — All 5 floors validated and structurally sound
